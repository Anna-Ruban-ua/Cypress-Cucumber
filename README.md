# Telnyx Cypress-Cucumber E2E Testing Project

## Summary of Repo

This repository contains automated end-to-end tests for the Telnyx website, written in Cypress with TypeScript and integrated with Cucumber. The project follows the Page Object Model (POM) architecture and implements structured Gherkin-based test cases covering both positive and negative scenarios across different site components (e.g., search, footer navigation).

## Requirements

- Node.js (latest LTS recommended)
- Cypress
- Cucumber preprocessor (@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor)
- TypeScript
